THIS BRANCH IS TO UPDATE ALL THE DIGITAL FILES TO SOLIDWORKS FILES, OPTIMIZE THE PARTS TO BE MORE ACTURATE. I will also try and update the parts list for US distributors. (still in metric).


OpenKnit is a project that offers a new digital fabrication tool, an open-source knitting machine that can create ready-to-wear clothes from digital files. 

The documentation for the Wally340 is outdated, currently working on the development of the Wally120 since it√ïs cheaper, smaller, easier to assemble and it works better. Although, the improvements of the Wally120 can be scaled up if you want to create bigger garments.

WARNING: this project is at an early stage of development, every piece of hardware and software is in beta version, testing and testing, if you are an adventurer this is a place for you.
